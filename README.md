# RFM & Customer Retention Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of customer retention and segmentation based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) analysis. The report provides insights into customer behavior and suggests actionable strategies to improve retention and increase customer lifetime value.

## Prerequisites:
- Power BI Desktop (tool used for the analysis).
- RFM dataset of customers to analyze behavior patterns.

### Key Segments:
- **Total Customers Analyzed:** 4,413 customers
  - **Low-Value:** 1,037 customers
  - **Mid-Value:** 1,696 customers
  - **High-Value:** 1,680 customers

### Customer Segments Based on RFM Analysis:
- **VIP/Loyal Customers (1,680 customers):** The most valuable and loyal customer group.
- **Potential Loyal Customers (1,233 customers):** Customers who show promise of becoming more loyal.
- **Can’t Lose Customers (531 customers):** Customers at high risk of churn and require immediate attention.
- **Lost Customers (506 customers):** Customers who have already churned.
- **At Risk Customers (463 customers):** Customers at high risk of churning soon.

### Customer Retention Insights:
- **Heatmap Visualization:** Demonstrates a month-over-month decline in retention, especially after the first 2–3 months.
- **Highest Retention:** Occurred in December 2009, with 1,045 new customers.
- **Retention Cohorts:** Each cohort experiences a significant retention drop after the first month.

## Recommendations:
1. **Retain VIP/Loyal Customers:**
   - Enhance loyalty programs, personalized offers, and exclusive deals to prevent churn and boost engagement.

2. **Upsell/Cross-Sell to Potential Loyal Customers:**
   - Design campaigns with loyalty incentives, discounts, and targeted promotions to convert these customers into VIPs.

3. **Re-engage At Risk & Can’t Lose Customers:**
   - Create win-back campaigns, personalized communication, and offers for these customers.
   - Analyze their purchasing behavior to address the root causes of churn.

4. **Improve Initial Retention Rates:**
   - Focus on strong onboarding programs and post-purchase engagement within the first 30 days.
   - Implement follow-up marketing strategies to increase retention.

5. **Reactivate Lost Customers:**
   - Consider a reactivation campaign with compelling offers for lost customers.
   - Gather feedback to understand why they churned and how to prevent future loss.
